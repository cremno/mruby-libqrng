TODO
====

- mruby_qrng_generate_password: allow only strings with (printable?) single byte characters?
- add the other functions (byte_array -> String, int -> Fixnum, double -> Float)
- Linux support (see Makefile in qrngdownload-Linux-XXBit.tar.gz)
- SSL support
- has mruby a rb_ensure counterpart?
- use GitHub Issues instead of this file
